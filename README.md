## 🚀 Features

### 🔒 Core Hardening
- Disable vulnerable WordPress features (XML-RPC, file editor, unsafe REST endpoints).
- Must-Use Plugin mode to prevent deactivation by attackers.
- Prevent PHP execution in uploads and unsafe directories.
- Enforce safer permissions and configuration rules.

### 🛡 Intrusion Detection
- File integrity monitoring with baseline hashing.
- Suspicious file detection (PHP shells, obfuscated payloads).
- Plugin/theme tampering alerts.
- Admin account creation auditing.

### 🔐 Login & Firewall Protection
- Brute force protection and login rate limiting.
- IP blocking and temporary lockouts.
- Early-stage request filtering (WAF-style behavior).
- Optional 2FA enforcement (planned).

### 🧬 Malware Detection
- Signature-based detection for known malware families.
- Heuristic scanning for altered or suspicious code.
- Pattern-based detection for common WordPress exploit kits.

### 🧰 Remediation Engine
- Auto-generated Linux hardening script based on detected issues.
- Guidance for hosting-panel users without SSH access.
- Recommended fixes for PHP config, permissions, and server settings.

### 🧱 Developer-Friendly Architecture
- Modular scanners (extendable).
- Fully namespaced codebase.
- WP-CLI command support (planned).
- Clear class-based structure for easy contributions.
